This repository contains my personal notes on the book **The Elements of Statistical Learning** by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman.

The Elements of Statistical Learning is a comprehensive guide to statistical learning methods, blending theory and practical applications. 

It covers key topics in machine learning, including regression, classification, model selection, and unsupervised learning. 

The book is ideal for statisticians, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners seeking a deeper understanding of the subject.

A background in linear algebra, calculus, and probability/statistics is required.
